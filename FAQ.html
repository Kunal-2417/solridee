                    <div class="accordion-body">The parties to this agreement are the lessor and the lessee where City Cycling is the Lessor & the customer is the
                    lessee. The terms of the rental agreement are as follows:
                    
                    Tenure of Contract:
                    
                    The contract has a lock-in period that is equivalent to the tenure of the contract that is agreed by the Lessee in the
                    contract. Contract shall not be terminated before the tenure. In case of early termination,1 week prior notice has to be
                    given otherwise some extra charges which is 50% of the cycle rental has to be paid by the customer. Similarly, the
                    contract can be extended for a minimum period of 1 month by notifying us 1 week prior to the end of the contract. If the
                    rent is not paid within 2 weeks of the due date, the lessor has the right to pick up the rented items back from Lessee’s
                    premises.
                    
                    Payment policy:
                    
                    The refundable deposit has to be paid in full online while placing the order. The remaining deposit can be paid upon
                    delivery via Credit/Debit card/cash or online system.
                    Extra charges (if any) have to be paid at the time of delivery. This will be discussed before the delivery.
                    Lessee will receive email reminders on their registered id .
                    Monthly/weekly rentals have to be paid online before the due date to avoid late payment charges of Rs.100 –
                    Refundable deposit does not include any monthly rent. It is simply a security deposit which takes care of the damages
                    (if any) and any default in payments.
                    Please note that the lessor has the right to physically remove the rented item in the event of default on payments if
                    not paid within due date .
                    Delivery policy
                    
                    The lessee or his/her representative has to be present at the agreed date and time. Otherwise extra shipping costs will
                    be charged by the lessor.
                    Delivered items cannot be returned unless they have major defects & are non-functional. Once accepted by the lessee or
                    his/her representative at the time of delivery, items will not be replaced before completion of the tenure.
                    Though we conduct detailed quality checks before delivery, the lessee is expected to check if there are any damages at
                    the time of delivery and report the same to representative of lessor and photos shall be captured of the same.
                    Photos of the lessee will be taken with the items delivered for our records.
                    Please note that the lessee should ensure the entry of delivery vehicle inside the premises.
                    Pick-up policy
                    
                    The lessee needs to inform the lessor 1 week prior to the end of the contract if he wishes to extend or end the
                    contract. The lessor will send across a notification regarding the same as well.
                    Pick-up date and time will be mutually decided by lessee and lessor.
                    The lessee needs to be present at the agreed date and time. If a ‘mutually scheduled’ delivery needs to be rescheduled
                    due to non availability of the lessee, additional logistics costs incurred will be charged to the lessee.
                    Damage policy
                    
                    The lessee agrees to pay for any damage to, loss of, or any theft (disappearance) of items, regardless of cause or
                    fault. Item damaged beyond repair will be paid for at its Market Price.
                    Any damage which is a result of raw material or manufacturing defects will not be chargeable to the lessee.
                    Any damage that results in the product being unusable will result in the value of the product being charged to the
                    lessee.
                    Any variation showing damages, if ascertained as not caused by normal wear and tear, will be charged and would have to
                    be borne by the lessee.
                    Refund policy
                    
                    If a clean chit is provided basis the QC report, the entire refundable deposit will be credited to the account of the
                    lessee without any interest within 7 working days. Please make sure that the account details for the transfer are shared
                    with the lessor.
                    This damage cost will be mitigated from the refundable deposit paid by the lessee.
                    Refund amount will be transferred to account from where initial deposit was received.</div>
